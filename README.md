## DIY Glove Controlled Robotic Hand: Control a servo motor hand with the power of a glove and DIY flex sensors!

This project uses budget items and DIY parts to create a fully functional robotic hand that can be controlled by a glove with flex sensors. It is an introduction project to the world of biomechanical engineering and design. Starting from the basic building blocks of foam and string, you will explore how physical mechanics are combined with electronic parts to form an attention grabbing project.
